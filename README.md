Solution:

To list all commits made by the author "JohnDoe" between "2023-01-01" and "2023-12-31"in Git,
you can use the git log command with the --author and --since and --until options. Here's the command:
$ git log --author="JohnDoe" --since="2023-01-01" --until="2023-12-31"
This command will display a list of commits made by the author "JohnDoe" that fall within the
specified date range, from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. Make sure to adjust the author
name and date range as needed for your specific use case.
